It is computed **by dividing a company's net income by its average invested capital over time**. An accounting rate of return (AAR) calculates an investment's average annualized return over a given period. An AAR can aid in evaluating various investment possibilities and making smarter financial decisions. \n\nThe AAR calculation frequently uses the historical compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of a specific investment to make a more accurate estimate of the compound return that an investment will generate over a certain period. This figure might assist investors in determining whether a business has been profitable in the previous year. \n\nAAR can be used to **compare the profits of businesses in the same industry**. However, it is essential to keep in mind that AAR is not always a good predictor of future outcomes since it can be influenced by several factors, including the company's prior performance and market conditions at the time of calculation. As a result, caution is suggested when using AAR to anticipate future performance.","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":2},{"columns":[{"text":"**9.4b** In this part of the question, we are asked to explain some of the flaws in the AAR rule.","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":3},{"columns":[{"text":"The AAR rule is subject to several potential weaknesses.\n\n1.
