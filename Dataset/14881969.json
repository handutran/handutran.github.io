This theory, allow us to link economic growth with the economies of scale in companies and industries. \n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":2},{"columns":[{"text":"Then, ***what does it mean to say that a proposed merger will take advantage of available economies of scale?***\n\n**Taking advantage of available economies of scale** means that, after the merger, the acquiring company will experience a decrease in the average cost per unit of production as the level of production increases.  \n\nConsidering the previous information, we can say that **economies of scale** are a valid and frequent reason for companies’ merging. If we look at the example in this exercise we have several facts: \n- Eastern Power Co. and Western Power Co. are located in different time zones. \n- Both companies operate at $60$ percent of capacity except for peak periods, when they operate at $100$ percent of capacity. \n- The peak periods begin at $9:00$ a.m. and $5:00$ p.m. local time and last about $45$ minutes.\n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":3},{"columns":[{"text":"Considering the facts, **why a merger between Eastern Co. and Western Co. might make sense?**\nA merger between Eastern and Western Companies would make sense due to: \n- After the merger, the companies could create synergies by sharing offices, administration, etc. \n- The new company, after the merger, will enjoy two peak periods considering the companies are located in different time zones. \n- They both are in the same industry: The power industry.
