The effect of considering changes in net working capital is that it more accurately reflects the company's current liquidity position. This information can be helpful in making decisions about whether to finance a new project or purchase a specific asset. \n\nAdditionally, changes in net working capital can indicate problems with a company's financial stability. If net working capital decreases significantly, it may be an indication that the company is in trouble and may need to seek financial assistance. Overall, changes in net working capital are important because they can provide valuable information about a company's current financial status.
