If a person has an affinity to something, they can forego researching about relevant information and just jump into it. \n\nThis can be costly since investing or trading solely based on emotions is not at all recommended. There are a lot of factors that can affect your emotion towards something so compared to concrete information, emotions should not at all be used when dealing with important choices.

This can be exhibited when we place some things, or even people, into stereotypes so when we see that this thing or person fits the stereotype, we immediately conclude based on the known characteristics of the other objects in the same stereotype.\n\nThis may be costly if for example, we see that the trend for real estate stocks are rising so we decide to  buy stocks for a lot of different real estate stocks. However, each stock still has their own characteristics and indicators so even though the trend is generally rising, some stocks may not be the same so we might end up losing money.

For example, when playing the roulette, there may be cases when the ball lands on black for consecutive turns so a person may bet on red since they believe that red has an increased chance due to the continuous streak of black. \n\nWe can remember that these events are independent so despite having consecutive streaks of a certain outcome, the probability of the other outcome will not be affected.
