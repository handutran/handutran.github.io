If that were to happen, then the seller would provide financing to the buyer for aspects of the buyer's business that are outside their contractual purchase and sale of goods. So, in that case, the buyer has a credit from the seller even after the goods are resold, and the buyer can use that credit for other purposes. To avoid such abuse, the upper bound on the length of the credit period is the length of the buyer’s operating cycle.
