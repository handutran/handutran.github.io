The liquidity of the finished product depends on the nature of the product. Some commodities can be easily converted into cash. While, on the other hand, some unfinished products may be illiquid and worth a little more than scrap value. \n\nThird, it is very important to distinguish between finished products and other types of inventories because the demand for an inventory item that becomes part of another item is usually called derived or dependent demand because the firm's need for these types of inventory depends on its need for finished goods. \n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":3},{"columns":[{"text":"**c)**  \nThe basic goal of inventory management is to minimize the sum of   carrying costs and shortage costs.  \n\nRecall that carrying costs represent all direct and opportunity costs of holding inventories and the costs of shortage are costs with insufficient cash reserves. \n\nNote that it is necessary to establish a compromise in inventory management because the transfer costs increase with inventory levels, while shortages or inventory recovery costs decrease with inventory levels.\n\n\n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":4}],"rating":0,"solutionUuid":"80c19a11-18b7-47c6-b2d2-8b57ea79dfa6","editorVersion":2,"answeredOn":null,"ratingCount":null,"solutionOrder":null,"totalSteps":4}],"textbook":{"authors":"Bradford D.
