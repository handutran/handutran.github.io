It establishes the conditions that allow for a takeover. Using this, firms frequently modify corporate charters to make acquisitions more difficult by establishing a high percentage of the shareholders who must approve a merger, for example. \n- **Repurchase and standstill agreements**. Standstill agreements are contracts that contain provisions that govern how a bidder of a company can acquire, hold, or voting stock of the target company. \n- **Poison pills and share rights plans**. A poison pill is a financial device designed to make it impossible for a firm to be acquired without management’s consent— unless the buyer is willing to commit financial suicide.\n\n- **Going private and leveraged buyouts**. When a firm goes private, the firm’s stock is taken off the market and no longer traded so it will be less likely. \n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":3},{"columns":[{"text":"***How do the target firm shareholders benefit from the defensive tactics of their management team?*** \n\nThe target firm shareholders benefit from the defensive tactics of their management team due to: \n- It might allow other firms to make offers to purchase the target firm and this could increase its price.
