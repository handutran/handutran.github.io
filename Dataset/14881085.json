These are considered low-risk since they are backed by the government. It is possible that there will be a negative rate but since it is risk-free, there is no risk that the investor will lose their capital.\n\nIn the treasury bond quote in the problem, we can see that the given rate is $-2.15\\%$. This indicates that if the bond holds through and the interest rates don't change, then the investment will yield a negative profit.

From this, we can judge it as a US Treasury Bond. What this means is that the security is almost always going to be called or will be held until the call date.\n\nFrom this, we will then disregard the yield to maturity since we will now be more concerned with the yield to call, which in this case is the fourth value on the table which indicates that the yield to call is $0.125\\%$. This is a very small rate but it can still be justified since it is positive unlike the given yield to maturity.
