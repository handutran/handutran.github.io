The **write-up effect** is the main advantage of a taxable merger because it allows the assets involved in the selling firm to be revalued or “written up” from their historic book value to their estimated current market value. This means the depreciation expense increases and, consequently, reduces the company's taxes.  \n**<span style=\"color: #4257B2\">Disadvantages</span>**. The **capital gains effect** is the main disadvantage. It refers to the fact that the firm’s shareholders may have to pay capital gains taxes in a taxable acquisition. Usually, they could ask for a higher price to compensate for taxes increasing this way the cost of the acquisition. \n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":3},{"columns":[{"text":"***What is the basic determinant of tax status in a merger?***\n\nThe basic determinant of tax status in a merger is that the stockholders in the target firm must retain an equity interest. In other words, the old stockholders should continue in the new company.
