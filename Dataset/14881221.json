Net income is the company's total income minus expenses. It includes cash generated or consumed by the company, as well as cash flows from financing and investment activities. The main difference between project operating cash flow and net income is that project operating cash flow excludes the effect of financing and investment activities.

The invested capital is the **key metric that we are trying to optimize in this project**, so adding back the net working capital investment helps to measure how well the company is performing in that area. Additionally, this metric can be used as a basis for future investments and decisions. Another reason why the net working capital investment was added back in the final year is because it can be a **good indicator of how well a company is managed**. A high net working capital investment typically indicates that a company is able to keep its working capital levels high and that it has a strong cash flow management system in place.
