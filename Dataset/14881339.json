When you purchase shares of a company's stock, you are acquiring a tiny portion of that company. Having stock in a corporation means you are a shareholder, which means you get a slice of its earnings.\n\n**Bond**: A bond is a loan from an investor to a corporation or government. The money is put to use by the borrower in the form of operations funding, and the investor is rewarded with interest on the investment. The market value of a bond may fluctuate over time.\n\n***Are bonds considered a more safe investment than stocks?***","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":2},{"columns":[{"text":"Treasury bills, government bonds, corporate bonds, and stocks are used by investors to balance their portfolios. The investment in stocks often results in a high return over the long term, but at the same time, these kinds of investments are very dangerous. Bonds, on the other hand, are debt securities in which the borrower pledges to return principle and interest at specified periods. The bond investment yields a return, although returns on bonds are lower than returns on stocks. The bond returns are also relatively low risk. When opposed to stocks, bonds are seen as a more secure investment due to the aforementioned reason.
