This occurs when a third party purchases a private firm's debt. So this kind of bond issue doesn't have to trade constantly, and there are no visible trading pricing. These investments are not publicly traded, do not need to be listed with the SEC, and are only available to accredited investors.\n\n **Public bonds**, on the other hand, imply acquiring money from public market segments in exchange for an issuance of capital assets; this is to accomplish particular corporate goals. The creditor is the investor, whereas the issuer is the debtor. Market prices in public bonds are easily known since they are often traded.","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":2},{"columns":[{"text":"## 15.10b \n\nInterest rates for private placements are greater than those on issuances. This is because private placement offers greater flexibility in terms of procedures in the case of a financial crisis and reduced security expenses. Due to the increased risk of not receiving a bond rating, a private placement investor may only invest if appropriate security is provided.\n\nFurthermore, the costs of flotation involved in selling borrowing are far lower than those involved with equity of sale. A private placement investor may potentially want a more significant proportion of substantial capital. ","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":3}],"rating":5,"solutionUuid":"6ec4f557-aafd-4235-887f-49ee76d20227","editorVersion":2,"answeredOn":null,"ratingCount":null,"solutionOrder":null,"totalSteps":3}],"textbook":{"authors":"Bradford D.
