While these are abnormally high-interest rates, they are actually applied to rather small of money. \n\nIn that regard, it's then debatable how can a loan $100 help someone, especially when they are able to write check, actual return value is also very small, only 15% more.

Adding up to that, the return date is rather short, which is a double-edged sword. While a week or two means the interest won't add up (as high as it is) it creates a pressure for lender to return the money quickly.\n\nOverall, the situation is kind of balanced out. Are interest rates high? Very. But it's applied to smaller sums of money and within small amount of time, which may/may not be a good thing. \n\nSo, are 'payday loans ethical'? Partially, again due to being applied to smaller amounts and due to not compounding for a long time, and due to the fact some return of investment factually is required. But of course, one should always precalculate how much they should pay back or make sure they aren't in a position where taking a loan is necessary.","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":4}],"rating":0,"solutionUuid":"ecdb3089-23bf-4bbe-bdf3-953943c95864","editorVersion":2,"answeredOn":null,"ratingCount":null,"solutionOrder":null,"totalSteps":4}],"textbook":{"authors":"Bradford D.
