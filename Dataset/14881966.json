Shareholders have their shares in the old company exchanged for shares in the new company. \n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":2},{"columns":[{"text":"**Why might investors prefer that a company split into multiple companies?**\nA specific case where investors could prefer that a company split up is if its production diversifies. Then the company could split up and create different companies according to the new and old activities. This could potentiate the value of each activity in different companies rather than having a super conglomerate with several different productive activities.  \n\nIn addition, split-ups are often publicized as a way of “unlocking” value, implicating a situation where the whole is worth less than the sum of the parts. In other words, a firm might choose to do a split-up when the value of the company if splits-up is expected to be higher than the entire company without splitting. This is known as **reverse synergy**.\n\n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":3},{"columns":[{"text":"Then, **is there a possibility of reverse synergy?**\nAs we declared before, split-ups are usually a way to “unlock” value and generate reverse synergies. Therefore, the answer would be, **YES, there is a possibility of reverse synergy** since separated managing of operations segments usually maximizes profits of each company.","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":4}],"rating":0,"solutionUuid":"a987c82f-1597-483d-b596-39e09441393a","editorVersion":2,"answeredOn":null,"ratingCount":null,"solutionOrder":null,"totalSteps":4}],"textbook":{"authors":"Bradford D.
