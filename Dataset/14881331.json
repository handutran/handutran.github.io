A positive excess return indicates that an investment outperforms its benchmark, whereas a negative difference in returns indicates that an investment underperforms.\n\n**Risk premium** can be defined as the additional return that an investor expects in exchange for taking on risk. It is the difference between the expected return on an investment or portfolio and the guaranteed return on a risk-free security or portfolio.\n\n**The difference** - The risk premium on an investment is the expected excess return, where the excess return is the difference between the return on a risk-free security and the actual return.\n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":2},{"columns":[{"text":"b) The **real risk** premium is a measure of the compensation required by investors for holding real (inflation-protected) bonds over period.
