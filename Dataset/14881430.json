By multiplying the return with the company's beta, this model incorporates the major company's capital asset pricing model risk. The assumption of constant alpha, on the other hand, **contradicts the premise that investment returns shift over time.**\n\n\nThis regression suggests that the errors are unrelated to the returns, and the firm means are irrelevant throughout investments.
