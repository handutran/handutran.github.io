Sunk costs are expenses that have already been paid for and cannot be recovered, regardless of the quantity of items produced. For example, if a corporation buys five-year-old equipment but only uses it for three months, the equipment has a fixed cost of $3,000. The corporation will have invested $3,000 in the equipment even if it is not used.

Since income taxes are a cost, at the break-even point, there would be no income to tax. So, if total costs exceed total revenues, then a net loss results. In this case, the company would need to either reduce costs or increase revenues to break even. Conversely, if total costs are less than total revenues, then net income will be positive. This is because the difference between total costs and total revenues is considered a profit. Finally, when total costs are greater than total revenues, then a net loss results, and the company would need to reduce costs or increase revenue to return to breakeven.Â ","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":true}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":4},{"columns":[{"text":"**11.3c** In this part of the question we are being asked to explain why the finance manager is interested in the accounting break even point.","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":5},{"columns":[{"text":"The **accounting break-even point** is when a company's expenses and revenue are equal.
