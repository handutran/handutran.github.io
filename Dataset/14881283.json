This is because the project's cash flow and its accounting profit are the same. The project breaks even on an accounting basis because its revenues equal its expenses. However, because its expenses are greater than its revenues, the project has an operating loss. In order to have positive cash flow, the project would need to generate more revenues than its expenses.

This would include sales revenue minus any costs related to those sales. To break even on a cash basis, a business must either create $0 in costs or generate income equal to all costs incurred. This could include expenses such as salaries, rent, and other operational costs. If a business does not create any cash flow, it may be in trouble and will need to find a strategy to raise funds. A company that generates more cash than it spends is doing well and will most likely continue to do so.
