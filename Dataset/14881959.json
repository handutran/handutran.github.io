Sharing gains\nIf cash is used in an acquisition, the shareholders of the acquired firm will not be involved in the potential gains generated by the merger but if the acquisition is made by sharing stocks, the potential gains have to be shared with new shareholders. The same will happen if the acquisition report losses. \n\n## 2. Taxes\nAcquisition by exchanging stock offers tax advantages since is generally tax-free while acquisition by paying cash usually results in a taxable transaction.\n\n## 3. Control\nIf an acquisition is made by exchanging stocks with the right to vote, then the company has to share a part of the company's control with new shareholders but an acquisition by paying cash does not affect the control of the acquiring firm. \n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":5},{"columns":[{"text":"Let's use a diagram to summarize when using stocks or cash in an acquisition!
