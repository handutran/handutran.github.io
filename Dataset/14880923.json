For the following requirement, we will discuss and learn the difference between an APR and an EAR.\n\nAs discussed in the previous step, **EAR**, otherwise known as *Effective Annual Rate* refers to a loan's annual interest rate after considering the nominal interest and the compounding period.\n\n**APR**, or *Annual Percentage Rate*, represents the annual rate a lender can quote its customer as prescribed by laws. We can determine the APR by multiplying the nominal rate by the number of periods in a year. Supposed a monthly nominal rate of 1%, therefore the annual interest rate is 12%.\n\nEAR and APR are dissimilar as the EAR focuses on the overall value of the loan, while APR is calculated based on the rate per period and is used by lenders as defined by laws.","images":{"latex":{"large":{"height":254,"srcUrl":"https://d2nchlq0f2u6vy.cloudfront.net/21/12/28/5742261aaf4f7783db585eb831697cdd/da05cac624f4dce17b8d67119395203e/lateximg_large.png","width":997},"regular":{"height":128,"srcUrl":"https://d2nchlq0f2u6vy.cloudfront.net/21/12/28/5742261aaf4f7783db585eb831697cdd/da05cac624f4dce17b8d67119395203e/lateximg.png","width":499}},"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":3},{"columns":[{"text":"C. For this requirement, we will determine the relationship between a stated interest rate and an effective interest rate and identify which is more relevant for financial decisions.\n\nThe relationship between the stated interest rate and the effective rate is that **the effective rate is computed based on the stated rate**. Typically, the effective interest rate is higher than the indicated rate since it considers the compounding of periods. The effective interest rates reflect the overall actual cost of a loan wherein the stated rate only presents the amount paid for each period. Hence we consider the EAR a reliable rate in assessing financial decisions over the stated rate.","images":{"latex":{"large":{"height":442,"srcUrl":"https://d2nchlq0f2u6vy.cloudfront.net/21/12/28/5742261aaf4f7783db585eb831697cdd/7912daa1146e4eafd9a6289333e8ecdd/lateximg_large.png","width":997},"regular":{"height":222,"srcUrl":"https://d2nchlq0f2u6vy.cloudfront.net/21/12/28/5742261aaf4f7783db585eb831697cdd/7912daa1146e4eafd9a6289333e8ecdd/lateximg.png","width":499}},"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":4},{"columns":[{"text":"D. For the last requirement, we will explain what continuous compounding is.\n\n**Continuous compounding** in interest loans is calculating the interest amount over an infinite number of periods.
