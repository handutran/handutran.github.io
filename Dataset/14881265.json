However, compared to incandescent light bulbs, CLFs are more cost efficient. This alone is a dilemma since you are choosing between environmental hazard and profitability. \n\nThe ban on incandescent light bulbs stems from it being cost-inefficient due to its shorter lifespan and higher energy consumption. \n\nBased on the data, it is not likely that a ban on this will be beneficial since it will already be out performed by CFLs and LEDs thus less people will use incandescent light bulbs.","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":true}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":2},{"columns":[{"text":"However, due to the emergence of LEDs, both CFLs and incandescent light bulbs may soon be completely phased out of the market since LEDs are proving to be better in all aspects compared to the other two bulbs.
