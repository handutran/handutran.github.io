It is calculated by dividing the company's operating income by its total assets. The higher the profitability index, the more profitable a company's assets are. The profitability index is a good indicator of a company's overall health. **A high profitability index indicates that the company is making money and can afford to expand or invest in new projects**.  A low profitability index, on the other hand, may indicate that the company is in difficulty and may need to make cuts in expenses or raise additional capital.","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":2},{"columns":[{"text":"**9.6b** In this part of the question, we are asked to indicate the profitability index rule.","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":3},{"columns":[{"text":"The **profitability index rule** states that a company should invest in a project if the profitability index is greater than 1.0. This means that the company would earn more money from the project than it would lose . This rule is usually used when making decisions about which projects to invest in. It helps companies **decide which projects are worth pursuing, and which ones should be put on hold or cancelled**. The profitability index is a tool that helps companies make informed decisions about which projects to pursue. It's based on the premise that if a project has a high profitability, then the company will earn more money from it than it will lose. This makes the project more profitable, and therefore more likely to be successful.

Consequently, even when an investment's net present value is bad, the profitability index would be less than one.\n\nAs a consequence, the net present value rule is similar to the profitability index rule.
