The **Efficient Market Hypothesis**,  known as EMH, is a hypothesis that asserts the financial market is efficient on its own. As a result, all relevant information about a company is reflected in the price at which it is being traded, and the stock is never over or undervalued.\n\nThe market efficiency hypothesis may be broken down into a variety of subcategories, each of which is named after a particular level of market effectiveness. There are three types of form efficiency: weak form, semi-strong form, and strong form efficiency.\n\n***What is the main distinction between weak and semi-strong form efficiency?***","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":2},{"columns":[{"text":"To clarify the differences between these two types clear, we will first discuss each of them individually:\n\nIn the weak form of efficiency, stock prices are reflected based on the track record of prior prices. This form of efficiency is not as effective as the strong form of efficiency. Investing in mispriced assets will not benefit from technical analysis. Even if the markets are only efficient in a limited sense, it is not feasible to gain higher profits in this scenario based on the price history of the past.\n\nIn the semi-strong form of efficiency, stock prices reflect not the track record of previous prices, but the information accessible to the public about a company's future prospects. In this kind of efficiency, stock prices represent the semi-strong form of efficiency. It also implies that the prices of assets be updated immediately whenever new information becomes available.\n\n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":true}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":3},{"columns":[{"text":"Based on the information presented so far, we can draw the following conclusion.\n\nIf a market exhibits a semi-strong type of efficiency, then the information that is readily accessible to the public will not be of any use in outperforming the market and generating greater profits. A semi-strong form efficient market has the same features as a weak form efficient market since historical data and stock prices are both publicly accessible information.
