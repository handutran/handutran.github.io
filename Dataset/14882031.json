This is why the term security deposit is used! It is an implementation of assuring that the lease will be executed.  \n\nThe security deposit can be used to support damaged or unplanned wear and tear, mostly associated with misuse or other human causes.\n\nA common practice is that the deposit is returned to the lessor at the expiration of the lease. In this task, we use this hypothesis for our solution.\n\n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":2},{"columns":[{"text":"From the previous task, we can obtain the following information: \n<center>\n\n|Variable|\tValue|\n|:--:|:--:|\n|Computer-assisted drilling system|\t $\\$ 7,300,000$| \n|Depreciation|\tStraight-line|\n|Lifetime (years)|\t$5$|\n|Tax rate|\t$21\\%$|\n|Cost of debt before-tax |\t$8\\%$|\n|Lease payment|\t$\\$1,625,000$|\n<center>Table 1.
