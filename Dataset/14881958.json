It is also known as **specific risk**, **diversifiable risk**, or **residual risk**.

This does not mean it can be one of the multiple reasons to merge but it should be accompanied by an increase in overall efficiency, growth, better position in the competence, or other benefits. \n\nIn other words, diversification is a reason to merge but if it also implies an increase in earnings, growth, better market share, etc. By itself, ***<span style=\"color: #C34632\">diversification does not ensure the company will grow and its assets increase their value, therefore, it will not justify the merger</span>***. \n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":7}],"rating":0,"solutionUuid":"04233452-43c3-4b2f-83e8-7b4f2a4199f0","editorVersion":2,"answeredOn":null,"ratingCount":null,"solutionOrder":null,"totalSteps":7}],"textbook":{"authors":"Bradford D.
