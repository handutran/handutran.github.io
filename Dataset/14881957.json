Revenue enhancement**\n**Revenue enhancement** is an important reason for the acquisition because is expected that the combined firm may generate greater revenues than the two separate firms. This benefit in revenue could come from marketing gains, strategic benefits, and increases in market power. \n\n**2. Cost reductions**\n**Cost reductions** is one of the most basic reasons to merge. Usually is expected that a combined firm may operate more efficiently than two separate firms may. \n\n**3. Lower taxes**\n**Lower taxes** are also a powerful incentive for some mergers. The possible tax gains could come from the use of tax losses, the use of unused debt capacity, the use of surplus funds, and the ability to write up the value of depreciable assets.\n\n**4.
