The net present value measures the investment's assets minus its liabilities and costs. A positive net present value indicates that the investment is profitable while a negative net present value means that the investment will lose value. \n\nIn this case, however, both companies have the same net present values at the same discount rates. This means that we cannot use the net present value as the basis.

The beta of a company is a numerical value assigned to the company's volatility in the market. This indicates how much the price of the company's stock fluctuates with respect to the market. \n\nA beta that is higher than 1 means that the movement of the company's stock price is greater than that of the market meaning it has higher highs and lower lows. \n\nA beta that is lower than 1 indicates that the movement of the market is greater than the movement of the stock price.

Therefore, when comparing the two companies, only Superior should invest since it has a lower beta. This means that the value of the company has a lower likelihood to dip compared to that of Dow which means that investing in this will be more profitable and more sustainable for Superior.
