As a result, <span style=\"color: #4257B2\"><b>zero-coupon bonds</b></span> typically trade at a discount, meaning investors make money when they redeem them for face value at maturity.\n\nDespite not paying out any interest, a <span style=\"color: #4257B2\"><b>zero-coupon bond</b></span> issuer deducts interest from its taxes every year. In the same way, the owner must pay taxes on interest accrued every year, even though the owner does not receive any interest. \n\nThere are two methods for calculating the interest - the <span style=\"color: #4257B2\"><b>straight-line method</b></span>  and the <span style=\"color: #4257B2\"><b>IRS amortization method</b></span> .\n\nIn the past, interest deductions were calculated using a <span style=\"color: #4257B2\"><b>straight-line method</b></span> . To calculate the interest deduction using the straight-line method, we can divide the total interest accrued over a period by the number of years in that period. That way, we'll get an average interest deduction per year.\n\n\nThe <span style=\"color: #4257B2\"><b>IRS amortization method</b></span>  is the method currently proposed by the tax laws. It says that we can determine the implicit interest by amortizing the loan. To do this, we should calculate the bond price change for each year.
