This means that essentially, there is very little to no room for profit since in an efficient market, the Net Present Value of each stock is equal to zero. What this means is that the initial cost is equal to the sale price of the product. As discussed previously, the discrepancies between the initial cost and the sale price are the areas in which traders and investors make profits. So in an efficient market, essentially, no profit is lost nor gained with different trading strategies.

The **Efficient Market Hypothesis**, known as EMH, is a hypothesis that asserts the financial market is efficient on its own. As a result, all relevant information about a company is reflected in the price at which it is being traded, and the stock is never over or undervalued.\n\nThe market efficiency hypothesis may be broken down into a variety of subcategories, each of which is named after a particular level of market effectiveness. There are three types of form efficiency: weak form, semi-strong form, and strong form efficiency.","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":2},{"columns":[{"text":"A market is considered to be efficient when an investor cannot regularly outperform it. The efficient market theory has the following **consequences** for investors who want to \"beat the market\":\n\n- If the market is robust and efficient, there is little chance to generate large gains by purchasing or selling stocks.\n\n- There is also a cost involved with trading that is related to selling and buying. In the event that this kind of investor disregards the trading cost, it will be unable to get accurate information on the price of the asset; as a result, the market will be even more efficient.\n\n- The rapid information systems lose value since the information is immediately reflected in stock prices.\n\n-  Technical and fundamental analysis are both ineffective for generating higher returns.\n\n- Profits that are produced just once do not constant over time.\n\n- There are no returns on investments in an efficient market, which means that all investments have a zero net present value (NPV).\n\n\n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":3}],"rating":0,"solutionUuid":"dad1e891-3a09-4bbb-b112-f03b458b35c5","editorVersion":2,"answeredOn":null,"ratingCount":null,"solutionOrder":null,"totalSteps":3}],"textbook":{"authors":"Bradford D.
