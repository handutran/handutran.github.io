However, one of the reasons that the equivalent annual cost may not be a good measure is that it does not consider the inflation rate. Aside from that, it only measures the cost so the difference in the technologies and innovations are not considered. This may give a faulty evaluation since a project may have higher annual cost but better innovations.
