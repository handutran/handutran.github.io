This may be in the form of cash, property, or stocks.\n* **Cash dividends** - These kinds of dividends are paid out to the shareholders in the form of money. Cash dividends may be the number of dollars per share or the board of directors may declare cash dividends to a certain percent of the share's par or stated value.\n* **Property dividends** - this kind of dividend is paid in kind or the form of the entity's assets other than cash and own stocks. When the board declared a property dividend, they must measure the property dividend payable and the noncash asset to be distributed. This is based on the standard set by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee or IFRIC.\n* **Stock dividend** - it is a kind of dividend paid out using the entity's shares.
