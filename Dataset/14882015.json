Then we must think about the effect of depreciation and taxes and other items associated with the purchase of the machinery that we must also show in the balance sheet.\n\nNow, if instead of buying the machinery we decide to lease it, then it will depend on the type of lease whether or not the logic of showing on the balance sheet makes sense.\n\n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":true}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":2},{"columns":[{"text":"We have two types of lease:\n\nIn a **capital (or finance) lease**, ***the risks and rewards are transferred from the Lessor to the lessee***.
