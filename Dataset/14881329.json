These are **dividend**  and **capital gains yield**.\n\nDividend: When an investor purchases a share of the business's stock, the investor is eligible to receive a return at the end of the year in the form of a dividend, which is a payment made by the firm on an annual basis. The dividend yield is often shown as a percentage of the stock price at the beginning of the period being considered.\n\nCapital gains yield: This is a term that refers to the rise in the value of an investment over time or a holding period of time The price change over the course of the year is used to calculate capital gains yield.","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":2},{"columns":[{"text":"b) Indirectly included in the computation of returns are any unrealized gains or losses from capital investments. The capital gain or loss for a stock is determined by the change in the stock's price, regardless of whether the investor still owns the stock or has sold it. This is because it is entirely up to the investor to decide whether or not he will sell the stock. Therefore, even if the stock is not sold, any unrealized capital gains or losses will still be included into the overall return for the company.\n\nThe unrealized component is also a gain for the corporation on a specific investment, thus to achieve an appropriate return total, both unrealized capital gains and losses will be included.","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":3},{"columns":[{"text":"c) A **dollar return** refers to the profit realized from the purchase of any item. A return expressed in dollars does not provide a clear picture of the amount of money an investor has earned relative to the amount initially invested. \n\nThe **percentage return** refers to an investment's return represented as a percentage. The percentage return paints a clear image of the return on an original investment of every dollar expressed as a percentage of that initial investment.\n\nThe percentage returns  are more convenient than other types of returns since they do not rely on the total amount. The percentage return may be easily calculated, and it is not necessary to determine the total holdings in order to get the total return.","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":4}],"rating":0,"solutionUuid":"68512590-bc78-4e6e-b5db-6836bd2bdab2","editorVersion":2,"answeredOn":null,"ratingCount":null,"solutionOrder":null,"totalSteps":4}],"textbook":{"authors":"Bradford D.
