An amount increases in value over time. The value of money obtained today differs from the value of money received one year later. For example, the current worth of $100 will not be the same after one year, five years, or ten years.  The value of the investment after one year is known as the **Future Value**. Therefore,  the future value of an investment is equal to the sum of the present value and the time value.

Compounding interest is computed not only on the original capital but also on the interest that has accrued over the course of many periods of time.  Compound interest varies from simple interest in that the interest is not reinvested, and so interest is earned on the original principal each month. Therefore, simple interest is only calculated on the principal amount.
