A positive net present value is generated when an investor purchases assets with the goal of increasing the returns on their purchase. However, it may sell assets that are losing money, resulting in a negative net present value  for the investor. Whenever there is a positive NPV, the values of the assets have a tendency to gain owing to the bidding process of the investor. This causes the NPV to decrease back to zero whenever there is a positive NPV. When the NPV is negative, the values of the asset go down, which causes the NPV to go up until it reaches zero again. Consequently, in a market with efficient characteristics, investments generate zero NPV.","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":true}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":4}],"rating":0,"solutionUuid":"589e1a2a-fad4-4edf-a68c-c8fd95bd446b","editorVersion":2,"answeredOn":null,"ratingCount":null,"solutionOrder":null,"totalSteps":4}],"textbook":{"authors":"Bradford D.
