This is considered risk-free since it has always proven historically that it does not have losing days where the rate of return is negative.\n\nHowever, due to this very low risk, the disadvantage of investing in Treasury Bills is the incredibly low rate of return. This then creates lower earnings from the investment.

Once you have an investment where the risk is not within your range, then it is disadvantageous as it can affect both your financials and your long-term goals.
