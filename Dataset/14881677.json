The grocery store trusted us and took a check and gave us an interest-free loan. She could charge us interest and make money in the name of interest instead of lending us an interest-free amount. This trick is unethical and in this case, the grocery store would be damaged. This process of financing is called check-kiting and is an illegal process of writing bank checks for which we do not have the amount of money in the account that can be covered on the date of realization.
