The model assumes that a stock's worth or current price is equivalent to the present value of the stock's cash flows. There seem to be three types of growth models in this model: constant growth, two-stage growth, and multi-stage growth. The sum of capital gain and the dividend yield seems to be the total rate of return on investment. \n\nWhereas if the investor paid any money for the investment, the overall rate of return would be calculated as capital gain plus dividend yield minus investment expenses as a percentage. The total return is usually equal to the sum of dividend yield and capital gains yield.\n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":1},{"columns":[{"text":"Next, let's see the formula we will use to solve the dividend yield is below.\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{ Dividend yield} &= \\frac{D_1}{P_0}\n\\end{align}$$\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n* $D_1$ is the dividend,\n\n* $P_0$ is current price of stock.\n\n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":2},{"columns":[{"text":"We have the following information.\n\n* The dividend is equal to $\\$2.34$\n\n* The current price of the stock is equal to $37.$\n\n\nNow, let's do the calculation according to the formula which we denote with $(1)$. \n\n$$\\begin{align*}\n\\text{ Dividend yield} &= \\frac{D_1}{P_0}\\\\[12pt]\n&=\\frac{\\$2.34}{37}\\\\[12pt]\n&=0.0632\\\\[7pt]\n&=6.32\\%.\n\\end{align*}$$\n\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the dividend yield is $\\boxed{6.32\\%.}$\n\n\n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":3},{"columns":[{"text":"\nSo, if the growth rate remains constant at $4.5\\%$, the capital gains yield will also be equal to the growth rate.\n\n\n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":4}],"rating":0,"solutionUuid":"7a2736a2-b5df-4870-a299-5f272b92ecbf","editorVersion":2,"answeredOn":null,"ratingCount":null,"solutionOrder":null,"totalSteps":4}],"textbook":{"authors":"Bradford D.
