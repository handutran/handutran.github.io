Take, for instance, the scenario in which you want to put $24,099 in TMCC and anticipate receiving $100,000 after 30 years. Supposing that TMCC finds a cheaper source of financing after ten years, it will \"call\" back the bonds, which means it will pay you a fixed quantity of money and then borrow from somewhere else. Reinvestment risk refers to the possibility that you may get a quantity of money, but then you will have to invest that money somewhere else at a lower interest rate.","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":3}],"rating":0,"solutionUuid":"7849c5a1-d93a-4905-bbe6-dce445a9b6f2","editorVersion":2,"answeredOn":null,"ratingCount":null,"solutionOrder":null,"totalSteps":3},{"id":6084534,"modifiedOn":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000000","steps":[{"columns":[{"text":"For this exercise, we need to consider the security offered by TMCC is callable and we need to argue if this is a desirable trait or not for an investor.","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":true}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":1},{"columns":[{"text":"In the case of a security-like bond that thas called provisions, meaning that the issuer added a clause that states that they are able to buy back the product after a certain time, the investor assumes an extra risk.

If we consider the previous example, the buyer will have the opportunity to buy a similar security from the same issuer but now the expected return rate will be lower.
