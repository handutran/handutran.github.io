Two assumptions underpin the company's ability to continue its current sustainable growth rate:\n- The first one is that the new capital in the company shouldn't be sold. \n\n- The second one is that the company's financial policy should be fixed.\n\nOutside equity or a larger debt-equity ratio allows a corporation to develop faster than what is sustainable. The sustainability growth rate shows an explicit relationship between the companyâ€™s four main business areas such as operational efficiency, asset efficiency, dividend policy, and debt-to-equity ratio. These categories have a direct impact on a company's sustainable growth rate, which highlights the firm's explicit tie to each other. Thus, if the firm alters its dividend policy by raising the retention ratio, or if its total asset turnover rises, the company might expand faster than its profit margin grows.","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":3}],"rating":0,"solutionUuid":"133f9633-fdad-43ab-b078-fec2b9f0e01e","editorVersion":2,"answeredOn":null,"ratingCount":null,"solutionOrder":null,"totalSteps":3}],"textbook":{"authors":"Bradford D.
