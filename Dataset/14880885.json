It is always less expensive to get cash now than to receive the same amount of future cash flows later on, since cash received now may be invested immediately, generating a larger return than a promise to receive cash in the future. In order to compute the present value of a financial asset, it is required to first determine the interest rate that will be utilized for discounting purposes. The market rate of interest is the most theoretically correct rate of interest; nevertheless, the rate of interest may be adjusted upward or downward to account for perceived risk associated with the underlying cash flows. For example, if the cash flows are regarded to be very problematic, a higher discount rate may be warranted, resulting in a lower current value.","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":2},{"columns":[{"text":"b) The process of **discounting** a future amount back to the present is the opposite of **compounding**.

DCF may be used to estimate the current value of an investment based on its expected future return. This method forecasts a sequence of future cash flows or profits, after which it discounts them to account for the time value of money. The temporal value of money is discounted from a series of projected future cash flows or profits. To put it another way, one dollar now is worth more than one dollar in the future because that dollar may be put to work for you in the form of investments in the future. In order to assess whether or not an investment's future cash flows are worthwhile, discounted cash flow applies a discount rate.","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":4},{"columns":[{"text":"d) Formula for calculating the present value is shown below in the following way:\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\n\\text{PV}=\\dfrac{\\text{FV}_{\\text{t}}}{(1+\\text{r})^{\\text{t}}}\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nWhere:\n\nPV = Present Value\n\nFV$_{\\text{t}}$ = Future Value\n\nr = Interest Rate\n\nt = Number of Periods\n\n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":5},{"columns":[{"text":"According to the provided information, we can see that the future value (FV$_{\\text{t}}$) is $1, so we will substitute the given value into equation from step 5 as follows:\n\n$$\n\\text{PV}=\\dfrac{1}{(1+\\text{r})^{\\text{t}}}\n$$","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":6}],"rating":0,"solutionUuid":"dbffed33-e97e-417d-b8f5-e3ae664799cd","editorVersion":2,"answeredOn":null,"ratingCount":null,"solutionOrder":null,"totalSteps":6}],"textbook":{"authors":"Bradford D.
