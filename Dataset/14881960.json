Takeovers are also commonly done through the merger and acquisition process but they encompass a broader set of activities than just acquisitions.

It establishes the conditions that allow for a takeover. Using this, firms frequently modify corporate charters to make acquisitions more difficult by establishing a high percentage of the shareholders who must approve a merger, for example. \n- **Repurchase and standstill agreements**. Standstill agreements are contracts that contain provisions that govern how a bidder of a company can acquire, hold, or voting stock of the target company. \n- **Poison pills and share rights plans**. A poison pill is a financial device designed to make it impossible for a firm to be acquired without management’s consent unless the buyer is willing to commit financial suicide!\n- **Going private and leveraged buyouts**. When a firm goes private, the firm’s stock is taken off the market and no longer traded so it will be less likely. \n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":3},{"columns":[{"text":"## b.\nThe goal of this task is to explain what a share rights plan is and how it works.

It allows existing stockholders to purchase stock at some fixed price should an outside takeover bid come up, discouraging hostile takeover attempts. It differs quite a bit in detail from company to company; we will describe a kind of generic approach here. \n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":5},{"columns":[{"text":"***How does a shareholder rights plan work?***\n\nThe way a shareholder rights plan works can be demonstrated with an example: \n\nCompany $A$ notices that its competitor, Company $B$ has purchased more than $20\\%$ of its common shares. Then, a **shareholder rights plan** might stipulate that existing common shareholders have the opportunity to buy shares at a discount to the current market price. \n\nThe goal is to make share purchases above the limit set in the shareholder rights plan unpalatable, that is why it is also called the **poison pill** (in relation to the spy world). \n\nBy being able to purchase more shares at a lower price, investors receive immediate incomes and, achieve their goal of diluting the shares held by the competitor. The takeover attempt is been controlled since it is now more difficult and expensive. \n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":6}],"rating":0,"solutionUuid":"0a9b9a7c-157e-43a9-a260-e73188265082","editorVersion":2,"answeredOn":null,"ratingCount":null,"solutionOrder":null,"totalSteps":6}],"textbook":{"authors":"Bradford D.
