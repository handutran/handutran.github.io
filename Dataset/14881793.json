Optimism is a person's ability to see and expect a good outcome out of something. This means that **overoptimism** can create an illusion wherein a certain event has a very high chance of having a good outcome while discounting the chance of it having negative outcomes.\n\nThis can be costly especially when investing in up and coming stocks or in start ups. Overoptimistic people can disregard factors that can indicate that the project is bound to fail or is bound to generate losses because they are highly optimistic that the stock or start-up can bounce back easily.

However, **confirmation bias** refers to a person's ability to downplay or disregard information that is not similar to their insights. This happens when a person is already set on something so when they are presented with the pros and cons, they will only often take note of the pros. \n\nConfirmation bias can be costly since a person can have an affinity to a certain product from a company so that person chooses to invest in it despite many indicators telling otherwise. This happens because that person only listens to information that supports their stance on the product or company. So even if the disadvantages outweigh the pros, they will still invest in the product due to their bias.
