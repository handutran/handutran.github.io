This model assumes that dividends paid by a company will continue to rise through a constant rate of growth for an indefinite period. This method helps investors calculate a stock's current value based on future dividend payments.\n\nTo calculate the value of a stock, the model takes the infinite sequence of dividends per share and discounts them to the present using the required rate of return.\n\nIt is based on the mathematical properties of an infinite series of numbers growing at a constant rate:\n\n$$\\text{P} = \\dfrac{D}{r - g}\\tag{1}$$\n\nWhere:\n\nP- the current share price\n\nD - the next dividend the company has to pay\n\ng - the expected growth rate\n\nr - the required rate of return ","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":2},{"columns":[{"text":"Recall the relationship between the next year's dividend and the current dividend is:\n\n$$D= D_0(1+g)$$\n\nwhere $D$ is the next year's dividend, $D_0$ is the current year's dividend and $g$ is the growth rate.\n\nHence, by inputting the above into Eq.$(1)$, we get :\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} {\\textbf{$P_{0}$} = \\dfrac{\\textbf{$D_{0}$} \\text{$\\times$} (1+g) }{{\\text{R - g }}} } \\end{aligned} \\tag{2}$$\n\nWhere, \n\n$P_0$ is the current price\n\n$D_o$ is the current dividend\n\n$r$ is the required rate of return \n\n$g$ is the expected growth rate\n\n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":3},{"columns":[{"text":"We are given the following information:\n\n1.
