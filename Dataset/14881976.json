This method requires that all assets and liabilities, of the target firm, be measured at fair market value. With this method, an asset called goodwill is created to help for accounting purposes. \n\nTo define goodwill we can deduct from the purchase price of a company the difference between the net fair market value of identifiable assets and the company's liabilities. \n\nLet's see formula 1:\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{Goodwill} = P-(A-L)\n\\end{equation}\n$$\nWhere: \n\n$P$ is the purchase price of the target company,\n \n$A$ is the fair market value of assets, and;\n \n$L$ is the fair market value of liabilities.\n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":2},{"columns":[{"text":"Let's also recall, ***what is a balance sheet?***\n\nThe **balance sheet** is a photo of the financial health of a firm. It presents what a firm owns (its assets), what a firm owes (its liabilities), and the difference between the two (the firm’s equity) at a given point in time. The balance sheet identity or equation can be determined as follows: \n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{Assets} = \\text{Liabilities} + \\text{Shareholders’ equity} \n\\end{equation}\n$$\n\nIs important to say that both sides of the balance sheet present the same total since in the left part all assets are listed (current and fixed) and, in the right part, liabilities and equity are presented. It is perfectly balanced, hence its name. \n\nWhen two companies merge, the values of their balance sheets are combined, and usually added. Only when fair market values are different, the value added is the market value instead the book value.  \n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":3},{"columns":[{"text":"Figures 1 and 2 show the given information for the two company's balance sheets pre-merger in a spreadsheet:\n\n<center><img src=\" https://slader-solution-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/882e3822-9ba7-47e7-9c8b-affb9e1b9ea3-1661302446737941.png \" width=\"pixel\">  <br>Figure 1.
