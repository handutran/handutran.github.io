The present value is calculated by considering the amount of money that could be earned by investing the cash flow stream for a certain period, then subtracting the cost of the investment. The result is the present value of the cash flow stream. NPV is used to help companies make decisions about whether to invest. According to the NPV rule, a firm should **accept all positive net present value projects and reject all negative net present value ones**. When comparing the worth of a project to the initial investment, the net present value (NPV) criterion is applied. A project with a positive net present value is worth more today than it was when it was first invested, while one with a negative net present value is worth less today. The NPV rule is used in business to **assess which projects should be pursued and which should be abandoned**.","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":2},{"columns":[{"text":"**9.1b**  In this question, we are asked to explain what we think it signifies if an investment has a net present value of $1,000.","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":3},{"columns":[{"text":"This means that the investment is projected to bring in $1,000 more than it costs. In other words, the NPV is the amount of money the investment is expected to bring in, given the current state of the market and other relevant factors. This number can be helpful in making decisions about whether to invest in something. However, it's important to note that NPV is not the only factor that should be considered when making investment decisions. Additionally, net present value is **not always a reliable indicator of future performance**. So, always consult other sources of information before making a decision.
