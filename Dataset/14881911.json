The price of the call option increases because higher interest rates also mean an increased interest income, hence call option attracts more potential holders. \n\nOn the other hand, the put option has an indirect relationship with interest rates; an increase in interest rates leads to a decline in put options. Holders hold the put option once interest rates are high, therefore decreasing its price and becoming less attractive to potential holders.
