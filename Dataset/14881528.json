This usually results in more significant revenues than obtained through a traditional IPO. \n\nAs a result, individual investors are increasingly buying shares directly from the company instead of investment banks. However, since this practice is available to the public, some of whom are less knowledgeable and may have an inaccurate interpretation of the securities, it may result in a sudden decline in the investor company's share value.\n\n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":2},{"columns":[{"text":"**Traditional IPOs**, on the other hand, employ the same selling approach but issue the shares at the lowest possible price. An investment company that serves as an underwriter for the issuance prepares a selling of the company shares. Costs are paid to the underwriter in exchange for their services. \n\nHowever, due to potential losses, investors' assistance is constrained to investment planning.","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":3},{"columns":[{"text":"As can be seen from the information provided in this case, **a Dutch auction is the best method for the company to go public.**\n\nThe Dutch auction not only effectively allows investors to make in the bidding by listing the value of shares they can purchase and the number of shares they intend to acquire, but it also allows the company to reduce the expenses associated with issuing shares to the general public.\n\nThe company benefits from the Dutch auction because it intends to offer its securities at a high possible price to initial shareholders before selling to the general public in an IPO at the minimum possible price. However, this may lead to a disparity in the number of top bidders in the sale. The disparity may look radical, but it is far better than the traditional approach of investment banks attempting to decide the best price on their own.","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":4}],"rating":0,"solutionUuid":"a16c027b-7160-4b5d-b04a-d0a89086f9a2","editorVersion":2,"answeredOn":null,"ratingCount":null,"solutionOrder":null,"totalSteps":4}],"textbook":{"authors":"Bradford D.
