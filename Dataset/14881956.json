According to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), all companies must run a test for goodwill impairment annually. \n\nFor the process of impairment to be efficient, companies have to measure their assets in the fair market before testing for impairment. If the asset become impaired then the entire impairment amount must be registered as a loss in the income statement and is also reported as a reduction in the goodwill account. \n\nThe amount that should be recorded as a loss can be calculated by deducting the asset´s carrying value from the asset’s current fair market value. This amount could never be negative because we cannot deduce a higher value than the asset's carrying values. \n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":6}],"rating":0,"solutionUuid":"21c939c2-bf91-420f-a73f-fac359530f1e","editorVersion":2,"answeredOn":null,"ratingCount":null,"solutionOrder":null,"totalSteps":6}],"textbook":{"authors":"Bradford D.
