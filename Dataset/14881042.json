This paper represents a commitment to pay the investor by the issuer corresponding to the money borrowed plus any interest rate in a period determined by the issuer.\n\n**Risk rating agencies** are entities whose objective is to analyze, study and finally qualify the risk associated with a particular asset. For this purpose, these agencies analyze the financial statements, solvencies, and other information that allow them to know the payment capacity of a company that decides to issue a fixed or variable income instrument.\n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":2},{"columns":[{"text":"Next, we will analyze why some companies consider it relevant to have their bonds rated by risk rating agencies.\n\nCompanies consider it relevant that these agencies rate their corporate bonds since this will allow investors to mitigate their uncertainty concerning the payment capacity that the issuer of the bond has at a certain time. A high rating on a corporate bond will indicate that the probability of a non-payment by the issuer is very low. Therefore, the risk will be lower, and so will be the coupon paid by the issuer.\n\nOn the other hand, if a corporate bond is rated low, the associated risk will be higher, so investors will require more compensation to finance the company, which means a higher coupon payment.","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":true}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":3}],"rating":0,"solutionUuid":"a6c3d103-a6e5-42ba-8d52-2b2173113c78","editorVersion":2,"answeredOn":null,"ratingCount":null,"solutionOrder":null,"totalSteps":3}],"textbook":{"authors":"Bradford D.
