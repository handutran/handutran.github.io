Operating leverage can lead to increased profits and returns on investment for a company, as well as increased stock prices. Additionally, operating leverage can help a company avert potential bankruptcy, as it can provide a cushion should economic conditions worsen. On the other hand, operating leverage can also lead to increased risk if the company is not able to effectively manage its finances. Therefore, the financial manager should carefully monitor operating leverage and take appropriate measures to ensure that it is not overblown or unmanageable.","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":true}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":6}],"rating":0,"solutionUuid":"f6e1b395-23a2-4fdc-a1d3-00e08ba7340f","editorVersion":2,"answeredOn":null,"ratingCount":null,"solutionOrder":null,"totalSteps":6}],"textbook":{"authors":"Bradford D.
