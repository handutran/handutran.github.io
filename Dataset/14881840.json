Based on the given information, we can see that both companies can benefit with an interest swap since company ABC has a lower floating interest rate while company XYZ has a lower fixed interest rate. When they engage in an interest rate swap, company ABC will have a lower fixed interest rate that can offset the losses in their floating rate while company XYZ will have a lower floating rate that can offset their losses in the fixed rate.
