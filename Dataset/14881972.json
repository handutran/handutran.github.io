The main reasons offered in the explanation are: \n\n- If managers of bidding firms tend to overestimate the gains from acquisition, then shareholders will have losses instead of expected gains from the merger.\n\n- Bidding firm is usually a larger firm so its percentage gains are much lower. \n- Management may not be acting in the interest of shareholders when it attempts to acquire other firms.\n\n- The prices paid in acquisitions fully reflect the value of the acquired firms. In other words, the sellers capture all of the gains.\n\n- The announced intentions to engage in merger “programs” long before that announce specific acquisitions makes that information to the market about the bidding firm is not updated, creating anticipated gains from mergers.\n","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":2},{"columns":[{"text":"***Let's summarize our findings***:\n\nAcquiring firm stockholders seems to benefit very little from takeovers and this is a complicated finding.
