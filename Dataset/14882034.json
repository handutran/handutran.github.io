So, the amount to be paid for the equipment usually is higher.\n\nThen, looking at the comparison with the lease, if this option is chosen the lessee will avoid this payment. So, we consider this an inflow in the incremental cash flow of lease vs. buy. \n\nIn the same thought, depreciation shield and lease payments are indeed outflows from leasing instead of buying.\n\n\nLet's illustrate this in Figure 1: \n \n<center><img src=\" https://slader-solution-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/96267ba8-6c08-4e4b-aaa8-4037f7e79852-1661914259467577.png \" width=\"pixel\">  <br>Figure 1.
