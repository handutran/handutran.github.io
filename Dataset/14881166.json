At this point, the investment has reached breakeven and the cash flow from the investment is equal to the cash flow from the original investment. This measure can be used to **compare different investments** since it is a simple way to calculate how long it will take for an investment to pay off. It is also important to note that the payback period may vary depending on the initial investment amount and other factors. Therefore, the **payback period is not always a useful measure when comparing investments.** However, it can be a useful tool for calculating how long it will take an initial investment to pay back its original cost.","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":5}],"rating":0,"solutionUuid":"213bb16d-1cf9-48cd-a279-b8ddd2f62143","editorVersion":2,"answeredOn":null,"ratingCount":null,"solutionOrder":null,"totalSteps":5}],"textbook":{"authors":"Bradford D.
