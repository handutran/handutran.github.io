The most common way to do this is by comparing the current situation to the pessimistic case and the optimistic case. In doing so, the forecasting risk can be calculated as either high or low which will allow for better decisions","images":{"latex":null,"additional":null},"hasInvalidKatex":false,"isTextOnly":false}],"isResult":false,"stepNumber":1},{"columns":[{"text":"**Sensitivity analysis** is similar to scenario analysis but in this type, certain values are kept constant in order to identify the biggest contributors to forecasting risk. This allows us to identify whether the factors that affect forecasting risk are those that can be easily resolved or not. \n\n**Simulation analysis** refers to the type of analysis that combines both scenario and sensitivity. In simulation analysis, different scenarios are tested but the range of values are fixed. This can help eliminate extraneous scenarios so that the analysis will be much more accurate.
